            'Children require guidance and sympathy far more than instruction' - Anne Sullivan
One of the first names that comes to anyone's mind when they think of people who have grown to be
successful irrespective of their disabilities is none other than Helen Keller. Not only was she the first
deaf-blind person to earn a bachelors of art degree, but a huge inspiration to many people around the
world diagnosed with disabilities. She has proved than we must never let something physical stop us
from achieving something great.<br><br>
Behind every successful student is an enthusiastic teacher. And such a guiding force who helped Hellen
Keller discover her potential was her teacher and lifelong companion, Anne Sullivan. She acquired
trachoma at the age of five which is an eye disease that left her partially blind and devoid of reading or
writing skills. After completing her education at the Perkins School for the Blind, she was recruited as a
teacher for Hellen Keller, not knowing she would change her life for the better. When she had started
teaching, she was gravely disappointed in the present curriculum of Helen which was extremely strict
and immediately realizied that it did not suit her. She used innovative and practical methods and made
learning fun for Helen.<br><br>
Anne's way of teaching had been the reason for Helen's steady progress which only continued when
Anne convinced Helen's parents to let her study in the Perkins School for the Blind. She continued
teaching Helen with utmost dedication which not only helped Helen but also the school by increased
funding making it one of the most famous and sought after schools for the blind.<br><br>
Anne Sullivan, if not a wonderful teacher, is a perfect example that a child's success can completely be
attributed to his/her respective teachers. The role they play can be replaced by none. Right from
teaching alphabets in nursery, their impact has inspired many to look within themselves and unearth
the potential they contain. On this Teachers Day, let us shower our teachers gratitude for their
immeasurable contribution. Let us remind ourselves that knowledge is available everywhere and
teachers help us find it.<br><br>
