        DID you know?
        <br /><br />
        Humans are imperfect. We make mistakes. The decisions we make are not
        always the best. Whenever we are presented with a choice and have a firm
        thought about doing something, sometimes we seem to hear a voice,
        suggesting a different thing, not from another person, but from inside
        us itself.
        <br /><br />
        Almost everyone knows this feeling and have heard the phrase 'the voice
        inside'. There are a lot of controversies about this voice. Some say
        it's our subconscious and some believe it's just a contradictory
        thought.
        <br /><br />
        But imagine, what if it's not a voice but a completely different entity?
        What if it's not you entirely? What if you don't even know it exists?
        <br /><br />
        That's a lot of imagination. But to think that this phenomenon is
        completely possible is quite surprising and intriguing. This is a rare
        and complex psychological condition known as multi personality disorder
        or in recent years, called as Disassociative Identity Disorder (DID).
        <br /><br />
        The name gives away it's basic characteristic which is having more than
        one identity and personality or disassociating from their surroundings,
        often from themselves.
        <br /><br />
        An extremely traumatic experience from the past might trigger this state
        as the person may feel so insecure that a part of them tries to escape
        mentally from any situation that may seem as too violent in order to
        protect the conscious individual. The causes suspected are abuse during
        childhood, depression, anxiety and trauma.
        <br /><br />
        This cannot be cured completely but treatment definitely helps. Since
        this a psychological condition, the methods to cope with it are
        psychotherapy or talk therapy, hypnotherapy and adjunctive therapy.
        <br /><br />
        Herschel Walker, an American football player, was a victim of DID who
        wrote about it in his book 'Breaking Free'. It talks about his feelings
        of disconnect from childhood and how he developed a tough personality to
        battle it.
        <br /><br />
        At the end of the day, we can learn a lot from people's lives. If we
        feel something similar, all we have to do is cross this hurdle in life
        with positiveness and strong attitude. And to prevent such a
        hair-raising condition, what come may, stay happy and keep negative
        feelings at bay.
