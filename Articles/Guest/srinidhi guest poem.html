        <h4>


A crowded morning with umbrellas in air,<br>
Dancing like peacocks on a rain fed evening.<br>
Swirling and drenching their illusional bodies.<br>
With all their genius minds in paradise.<br>
<br><br>
During the early hours of Charminar,<br>
With all the chaos and the chatter,<br>
The smell of Irani chai radiates like sunshine.<br>
The sound of thunder startles those,<br>
Tiny pearls in glass enclosed cases.<br>
<br><br>
In the flooded streets and alleys of General bazaar,<br>
Beautiful Kurtis branch out like leaves in the air,<br>
And the latest footwear in town finds its way home.<br>
Children pull at their mothers' sari lovingly,<br>
For a cup of freshly stewed sweet corn.<br>
<br><br>
Khairatabad, an epitome of cultural diversity,<br>
Is preoccupied with the festive preparation,<br>
A time when Lord Ganesha descends,<br>
To eradicate evil and showers his blessings,<br>
On his beloved devotees on planet Earth.<br>
<br><br>
The captivating aroma of biryani at Paradise,<br>
Mesmerizes my taste buds desperate for a feast.<br>
The tandoori grills are busy skewing delicacies,<br>
And the sweet paan waits for its turn patiently.<br>
Paradise is where the biryani legacy began.<br>
<br><br>
Hussain Sagar, the place where Lord Buddha resides.<br>
The rains are a gift of nature, my father says.<br>
People shower the lake with flowers and idols,<br>
In return for one-sided promises and wishes.<br>
The lake gives me hope for a better future.<br>
<br><br>
Once upon a time in Banjara hills,<br>
Globalization eliminated the rocky landscape,<br>
Leading to luxurious living and sky-high structures,<br>
Creating a magnificent view for writers like me,<br>
Inspiring art on a rainy day in Hyderabad.<br>
<br><br>
Hi-tech City, the hub for every engineering graduate,<br>
Stranded on the streets after s day's job,<br>
Amongst the hustle and bustle of strangers,<br>
Awaiting his mode of transport,<br>
And reminiscing far away memories of his own.<br>
<br><br>
Koti, the culmination of culture and art.<br>
Delicacies of various kinds create a sense of euphoria,<br>
Samosas and Jalebis stir your temptations,<br>
While tiny drops linger on the bangles in Sultan bazaar,<br>
And bookstore owners rush to rescue the knowledge bearers.<br>
<br><br>
Built by Nizams many centuries ago,<br>
Hyderabad holds its head high with pride,<br>
As it welcomes it's beloved guests,<br>
The wild winds of monsoon,<br>
Who emanate pearls of rain,<br>
And induce the fragrance of petrichor<br> 
On this heavenly day.<br>
<br><br>
