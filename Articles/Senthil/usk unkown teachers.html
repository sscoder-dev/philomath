            As we know that Teachers Day is on September 5 as a birthday of Sarvapalli Radhakrishna.
People are talking more and more about education today. Whether you hear
something on the news, hear about some college scandal, or discuss the rise of
college debt, we all know that change needs to happen in the education industry
and without teachers its impossible.<br><br>
About This Article:- I have written this Article so as to introduce the unknown teachers in
world....
So lets get started,
<br><br>
1)William Holmes McGuffey<br>
McGuffey was a college professor who became famous for creating the McGuffey Readers.
The Readers were essentially the first elementary-level textbooks and sold over 120 million
copies between 1836 and 1960.
<br><br>
2)Toru Kumon<br>
Kumon was a Japanese Math teacher who started creating worksheets to help his
son improve his Math skills, which developed into the Kumon method of learning.
He started opening learning centres in Japan in the '50s and now they're located
throughout the world. The program helps students with Math and language by
providing worksheets specially suited to their abilities.
<br><br>
3)Emma Willard<br>
Willard was at the forefront of the women's rights movement and used education to further
the cause. She opened the Troy Female Seminary in 1821, which was the first school for
women's higher education.
<br><br>
4)Booker T. Washington<br>
Washington was a former slave who put himself through school and then devoted his time
to educating children and adults in West Virginia. He also returned to teach at his alma 
mater (Hampton Institute) and eventually started the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial
Institute as well as the National Negro Business League.
<br><br>
5)Salman Khan (not the actor ðŸ™‚)<br>
Khan is a prime of example of the power of the internet. His khan acedemy is a free
online education platform featuring thousands of lessons on a variety of academic
subjects. The YouTube channel has over four million subscribers.
