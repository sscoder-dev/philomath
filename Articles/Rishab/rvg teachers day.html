            Teachers day in India is celebrated on 5th
            September every
           year.It is common knowledge that the birthday of former
           president Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan is celebrated as
           teachers day in India. What most people don’t know are his
           contributions and accomplishments. He was the first vice
           president of India and the second president of India. He was
           also awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1952 and the peace prize of
           the German book trade in 1961. He was also the ambassador
           of India to the soviet union and represented India at Unesco.
           He said that “Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be
           my proud privilege if September 5th
            is observed as teachers
           day.”<br><br> Teachers day has been celebrated in India on this day
           since 1962. Let us now see how other countries honor their
           teachers.<br><br> Tuesday 4th
            May is celebrated as teachers day in the
           united states. The first full week of may is celebrated as
           teacher appreciation week. While teaches day is celebrated
           on 28th
            march in the Czech republic to commemorate the
           birthday of John Amos Comenius. In Argentina it is
           celebrated on 11th
            September in memory of Domingo F
           Sarmiento a former president of argentina and educational
           reformer. <br><br>The most common national teachers day is 5th
           October as the same day is world teachers day. It was first
           celebrated in 1994 to commemorate the adoption of the
           1996 ILO/UNESCO recommendation concerning the status of
           teachers. Let us remember that each country celebrates the
           contribution of teachers. <br><br>On this teachers day let us not
           forget to remember and appreciate the people who made us
           who we are today.
