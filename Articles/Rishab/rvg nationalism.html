        <h4>
            
            Ever wondered why all leaders in the world feel very similar in policy and very nationalistic. Ever
                    wondered why all of a sudden this has happened ? <br>Well,the word nationalism is not new, it is a
                    tried and tested concept.<br><br>We have seen nationalism misguide nations like germany and we have seen
                    it guide nations to glory like usa , south korea. <br><br>The world is experiencing a new wave of
                    nationalism for a few years now. We can see this as leaders like donald trump(usa) , victor
                    orban(hungary), nicola duterte(phillipenes), jair bolsanaro(brazil) , shinzo abe(japan), narendra
                    modi(india)  are getting elected with huge margins. We have also seen that these leaders are
                    increasingly authoritarian with a few noted exceptions. <br>The reason for such people getting
                    elected can be attributed to multiple reasons such as a feeling of resentment within people. A
                    feeling of neglect and corruption <br> within the government can also be attributed. We have seen
                    that people associate such leaders as being problem solvers and they put the nation first. These
                    leaders have to act strong to maintain their image . <br>That brings me to my next point which is that
                    they either have to maintain their image as a man of the people or a problem solver or have to
                    jumble between both constantly.<br><br>
                    People think that such leaders are new and are the something the nation hasn't experienced
                    before . We forget that a lot of leaders were like this in the past. Leaders like abraham lincoln,
                    winston churchill, ronald regan, helmut kohl were leaders who were authoritian, nationalistic
                    ,efficient and had a great image<br> with the people. <br><br>We have seen a cycle where such people
                    are elected after a wave of anti-incumbency. The reason we think more such leaders are getting
                    elected because more of them have been elected at the same time instead of being spread out
                    over multiple countries over a long time. <br>The only thing we see is that they are new faces,
                    nothing else.
