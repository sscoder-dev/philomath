      <h4>
        Ever wondered why all leaders in the world feel very similar in policy
        and very nationalistic. Ever wondered why all of a sudden this has
        happened ? <br />Well,the word nationalism is not new, it is a tried and
        tested concept.<br /><br />We have seen nationalism misguide nations
        like germany and we have seen it guide nations to glory like usa , south
        korea. <br /><br />The world is experiencing a new wave of nationalism
        for a few years now. We can see this as leaders like donald trump(usa) ,
        victor orban(hungary), nicola duterte(phillipenes), jair
        bolsanaro(brazil) , shinzo abe(japan), narendra modi(india) are getting
        elected with huge margins. We have also seen that these leaders are
        increasingly authoritarian with a few noted exceptions. <br />The reason
        for such people getting elected can be attributed to multiple reasons
        such as a feeling of resentment within people. A feeling of neglect and
        corruption <br />
        within the government can also be attributed. We have seen that people
        associate such leaders as being problem solvers and they put the nation
        first. These leaders have to act strong to maintain their image .
        <br />That brings me to my next point which is that they either have to
        maintain their image as a man of the people or a problem solver or have
        to jumble between both constantly.<br /><br />
        People think that such leaders are new and are the something the nation
        hasn't experienced before . We forget that a lot of leaders were like
        this in the past. Leaders like abraham lincoln, winston churchill,
        ronald regan, helmut kohl were leaders who were authoritian,
        nationalistic ,efficient and had a great image<br />
        with the people. <br /><br />We have seen a cycle where such people are
        elected after a wave of anti-incumbency. The reason we think more such
        leaders are getting elected because more of them have been elected at
        the same time instead of being spread out over multiple countries over a
        long time. <br />The only thing we see is that they are new faces,
        nothing else.
