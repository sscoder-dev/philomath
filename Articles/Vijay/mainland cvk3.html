        Hey you patriot what do you know about the seven sisters? we know hardly
        anything. There are many problems, transport se le kar bijlee tak,
        surprised? Aren't these some basic facilities which are really
        important? But the media will never show this because this won't fetch
        them TRP. why do we need to care about them?<br />
        As their culture has different makeup? Seriously, come on! How does it
        matter. Do you know bout the Bogibeel bridge which is a combined road
        and rail bridge over the Brahmaputra River in the northeastern Indian
        state of Assam between Dhemaji district and Dibrugarh district promised
        by the government to the people in the year 1985, but this bridge's
        construction got over in 2018, 33 years for a 5 km bridge, huh? Not
        fair, Is it? If this was a city like Bombay it wouldn't have<br />
        taken so long. <br /><br />
        I Am Vijay and in the next few minutes we will be discussing the
        problems in the North East
        <br /><br />
        But these are'nt the only problems which our brothers and sisters face
        in North East. We share a 4,145 km long boundary with Bangladesh and its
        really difficult to manage such a huge border that's why illegal
        immigration is a major problem in North East. Idhar hum logo ki phle se
        hi itni badi population mange nahi kar pa rahe so can we afford it? See
        Bangladesh is our good friend but these problems can't be ignored,
        right?
        <br /><br />
        Wah par AFSPA yani Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) lagu hai.
        This was introduced in1958 in the Parliament of India that grants
        special powers to the Indian Armed Forces the power to maintain public
        order in ‚Äúdisturbed areas‚Äù. According to The Disturbed Areas (Special
        Courts) Act, 1976 once declared ‚Äòdisturbed‚Äô, the area has to maintain
        the status quo for a minimum of 3 months. One such Act passed on 11
        September 1958 was applicable to the Naga Hills, <br />
        then part of Assam. In the following decades it spread, one by one, to
        the other Seven Sister States in India's northeast (at present, it is in
        force in the States of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur {excluding Imphal
        Municipal Council Area}, Changlang, Longding and Tirap districts of
        Arunachal Pradesh, and areas falling within the jurisdiction of the
        eight police stations of districts in Arunachal. <br /><br />
        We all have read about many dynasties such as the Cholas, the Mughals
        and many more but have you read about the Ahom dynasty? I don't think so
        as this is<br />
        not taught in our schools so, let me tell you, the dynasty was
        established by Sukaphaa, a Shan prince of Mong Mao who came to Assam
        after crossing the <br />Patkai mountains. And do you know that they
        defeated the Mughals 17 times that wasn't an easy task at that time. The
        Mughals were really very powerful <br />and the Ahom dynasty had control
        over the North East for about 598 years. <br /><br />
        See, my intention of writing this article is really clear, don't let our
        northeastern brothers and sister feel alienated. Let me give you an
        example, when the event of partition took place India was divided into
        three countries Pakistan, India and Bangladesh respectively, where
        Bangladesh was initially known as East Pakistan<br />
        but it was really very far from it so, they felt alienated and they
        revolted and demanded a new nation. So henceforth this might happen with
        the case of<br />
        northeast India as well but we don't want any conflicts or any sort of
        divide because we already have faced the consequences in 1947 and we
        still face the consequences in some or the the other way. <br /><br />
        So as said here are some interesting facts about Northeastern India,
        <br />
        1. Arunachal Pradesh: famous for its culture and the mountains there's
        an interesting story of Arunachal Pradesh. Back in the past when Chinese
        troops attacked there to annex Arunachal Pradesh, people literally
        fought with the vessels they had against these Chinese troops just to be
        a part of India.
        <br /><br />
        2. Meghalaya: all the nature lovers from different parts of the world
        come here to enjoy the biodiversity of Meghalaya but you know there is
        something really<br />
        more interesting than, this it has the wettest place on the planet and
        has the thinnest village in Asia. <br /><br />
        3. Nagaland: one of my favourite places in the northeast and one of the
        five states of the northeast Nagaland grows the spiciest chillies.
        <br /><br />
        4. Manipur gave the world of boxing a legend Mary Kom. Many Indians
        think that Polo is not an Indian game, let me tell you Manipur is the
        place where Polo originated from.
        <br /><br />
        5. To all my tea lovers Assam is really special for you, right? But
        another interesting fact about Assame is, it is the only place in the
        world with the largest one-<br />horned rhino population. <br /><br />
        6. Our Indian girls have always made us proud but do you know one of our
        best performances in Olympics (gymnastics)is due to Deepa Karmakar who
        is from Tripura.
        <br /><br />
        7. See we Indians are really known for our creativity and our knowledge
        but do you know there is the cave in Mizoram that's crafted by a man
        with just a single hairpin. Isn't that amazing guys!
        <br /><br />
        Dekho yaar abhi aur batane Gaya toh tomorrow ho jaoge , but there's a
        lot you can go on the internet and check out. Even after reading this
        article and<br />
        knowing these facts if you think it's not worth preserving I can't
        really judge you and don't want to judge you but see even after knowing
        these facts majority of you might think it's worth preserving then why
        we don't really talk about the problems of the northeast, you know what
        recently what happened in Mizoram? two weeks before where the media was
        covering the news of Delhi earthquake which was'nt even that high
        magnitude one, but soon after Mizoram faced a 5 <br />Richter scale
        magnitude of earthquake but the media didn't even speak about it and it
        didn't show it in the headlines because it wouldn't have had fetched<br />
        them TRP and because its northeast what really matters right?
        <br /><br />
        4 days before they were floods in Assam and really the media didn't
        speak about it because the media is really busy with the ban on 59
        Chinese apps,matlab logo ne alternative apps dund kar use karna shuru
        kar diya fir bhi üòè and issue that we are facing on the borders of
        Ladakh because that fetch them TRP. What you and I can do is we can
        create awareness about it just by reading up these facts. Share this
        message with anyone you want.
        <br /><br />
        Thank you guys for taking out your valuable time and reading this
        article. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚úåüèª
