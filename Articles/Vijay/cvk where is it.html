            Today cybersecurity is a major concern on this planet. That's understandable because data is really very crucial. Now there's another aspect which is associated with cybersecurity but is completely ignored by the majority. We too have cybersecurity knowledge, and we even take precautions on our level. But we are missing out something. What's that? Wait you will come to know about it very soon.
            <br><br> 
            Now, just remind yourself how you were taught to maintain the basic ethics in your class and maintain its decorum. Now that's how a literate person is expected to behave, right?
            Of course. That's something expected from us when we are using any social media platform or when we surf the internet. This is what cyber literacy means, the ethics which everyone is bound to follow while using the Internet. Many of us follow these rules. But not everyone.
            <br><br>
            Now the point is there are still many people who are violating these rules.
            <br>
            They think, "Kya farak padhega, hume kon dekhega, this is my account I can do anything I want".
            If you think that there is nothing wrong in thinking so then you're actually wrong. Because your social media account is used by you to connect with the people.
            <br><br>
             Do one thing, go and open the Instagram profile of an Indian actress, you would find a hell lot of abusive comments. They don't use only cuss words but they just comment about such things which I can't really mention here. So much vulgarism, come on! And the interesting fact is that the majority of these comments are made by young adults or young men, who are the future of our country. Seriously?! This isn't what we expect from our country's forthcoming adult citizens, right?
             <br><br>
            There are even pages on social media which post the picture of an actress and ask boys to comment whatever they want to.
            <br><br>
            Now trust me this is the truth.  What can be done? You can just go and report these pages. This was just the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot more. Now, we all use YouTube, it has become the largest video sharing platform. Even you find similar trash there. Some YouTubers (foreign) who started " the golden digger pranks", <br>and some of those videos are good but when Indian YouTubers try to do the same, the picture was completely different.
            <br><br>
            These videos are actually named as pranks but there's nothing in these videos rather than molesting girls on camera or abusing them either. 
            <br><br>
            However, the intension of these videos is just to show how you will be rejected if you're not a rich guy. On the contrary, if you're a fat cat then, congratulations<br> she is all yours, seriously?! A couple of weeks back I came across a video where an individual was molesting a girl on camera and when she goes backs to slap him he askes her to look at the camera and shouts 'it's a prank! It's a prank!', what? Who does this? And even the girls seem to be happy after being molested.
            <br><br>
            See now the problem with us is we don't report such activities on the internet and that's a big mistake thinking that won't bring any change, but it's not that, Mahatma Gandhi quoted, "Bring the change in you, which you want to see in the world".
            <br><br>
            I would now simply conclude by advising you that report such activities because not only on the ground level, we should maintain ethics on the cyber<br> level as well.
