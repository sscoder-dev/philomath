        <h4>
            Popularly known as Sardar Patel, He was an
Indian politician. He served as the first Deputy
Prime Minister of India. He was an Indian
barrister, a senior leader of the Indian National
Congress and a founding member of the
Republic of India.<br>He played a leading role in
the country's struggle for independence and
was the leader of integration of India into a
united, independent nation . He is also known
as the iron man of India.<br>He is responsible for
the integration of approximately 512 princely
states which were once independent. They
were later divided into 28 states and 9 union
territories. The only exceptions are the union
territories of Jammu and kashmir and Ladakh.
These territories had been handled by the
prime minister at that time pandit Jawaharlal
Nehru.<br>We will not talk about the integration of
Jammu and kashmir into India and stick with
what the achievements of sardar valabhai patel were.<br><br>
He went to different kingdoms at the time of
independence and pursued the local leaders to
join the Indian state and made sure all agreed
to common terms sor that there is no
difference of power in each state.<br> There were
so kingdoms like the Nizam ruled area which
did not readily accept to join India or Pakistan
but wanted to create it's own independent state.<br> Unfortunately for them the iron man of India
then decided to use the Indian army to secure
the rich kingdom of Nizam.
He is a very respected man in the nation and is
also honoured with the the world's tallest
statue, the statue of unity which significance
the work done by sardar valabhai Patel of
uniting all the states of India.<br>The statue stands
tall near the sardar sarovar dam in Surat,
Gujarat which is his birth place.<br>The statue is
182 meters tall and the nearest challenger to
the statue in terms of height is the spring
temple buddha statue which is 128 metres tall .
<br>That is it for sardar valabhai Patel.
