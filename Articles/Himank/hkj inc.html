      <h4>
        You all must be wondering what INC stands for , it is INDIAN NATIONAL
        CONGRESS or famously known as CONGRESS . From its foundation on 28
        December 1885 by A.O. Hume, a retired British officer, until the time
        India gained its independence on 15 August 1947, the Indian National
        Congress was considered to be the largest and most prominent Indian
        public organization, as well as the central and defining influence of
        the long indian independence movement.
        <br /><br />
        Some of its early members were
        <br />
        ● William wedderburn
        <br />
        ● WC bonnerjee
        <br />
        ● Surendernath bannerjee
        <br />
        ● Mg remade
        <br />
        And many more.
        <br /><br />
        WC bonnerjee was selected as a leader of the INC in 1885. The party was
        formed to fight for basic rights for living which had been taken away by
        the British government which was ruling over INDIA. Indians at that time
        face extreme discrimination and frequent famines due to negation from
        the british. INC was formed to gain political power and help expel the
        British from the Indian subcontinent as not only present day India but
        Pakistan and Bangladesh were also included. This party was started to be
        recognized after 1920 when the famous freedom fighter of India Mahatma
        Gandhi became the leader of INC . They started a lot of nationalism
        movements and became the backbone of the Indian struggle for freedom .
        <br /><br />
        With constant pressure put by the British government to subdue the
        freedom movement INC fought back by launching movements like
        <br />
        ● Khilafat movement
        <br />
        ● Swadeshi movement
        <br />
        ● Non cooperation movement
        <br />
        ● Civil disobedience movement
        <br />
        ● Poorna swaraj movement
        <br /><br />
        Some of the facts we all must know about the olden day Congress party is
        that all the movements organised by them were only peaceful protests and
        when they took violent turns they were called off . many rules were
        broken by the important leaders in order to persuade people to come out
        to fight the British government which now had been ruling over the
        Indian subcontinent for 200 years starting from the Bengal province to
        the entire nation and in this process they were sent to jail for many
        times. Sometimes they were sent to jail for no reason under the Rowlatt
        act.
        <br /><br />
        Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the first prime minister of free India became
        the president of the INC in the Lahore session of 1929. He later on
        continued to lead the party to its glory and by the peak time of 1945
        when world war 2 ended the promise made by the British to leave Indian
        subcontinent was to come in force . The round table conference later
        helped to specify the demands made by Indians on how they would like the
        British to leave India to itself. This just a brief history of how the
        INC became the major political power from India in its freedom struggle.
        There are many mysteries yet to be discovered about this politically
        legendary party. There will be more articles to come up about this topic
        in the future so please hold on for them.
