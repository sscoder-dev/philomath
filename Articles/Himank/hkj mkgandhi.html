        <h4>
            On 2nd of October in the year of 1869, a legend,not only
            for 1 country but 7 and an inspirational personality for
            the entire world, was born to Karamchand Gandhi and
            Putlibai Gandhi in the one of the most western cities of
            India, porbandar. he has earned many names like
            mahatma gandhi, Gandhiji, etc . He is a lawyer by
            profession and went to south Africa to practice law,at
            that time south Africa was suffering from the apartheid
            system and gandhi having the Indian skin tone also
            became a victim to it.<br><br>
            He then started to protest against this system and lead a
            nonviolent campaign. He later came to the indian
            subcontinent which at that time was considered India,
            Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri lanka. It
            was under british control and gandhiji decided to teach
            the world how powerful non violence is. From January
            1915 (when he returned to India from South Africa)
            Gandhi led a series of non violent protests against the
            British government.<br><br> 
            Some of the most popular ones are<br>
            ● Dandi March
            <br>
            ● Non cooperation movement
            <br>
            ● Round table conference 2
            <br>
            ● Khilafat movement
            <br><br>
            He was a member of the Indian national Congress and
            had highly influenced its decisions to lead a nonviolent
            campaign. Many other political leaders like BR
            Ambedkar, Subhash Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru
            ,etc have been involved with some of his campaigns.
            Many of which later played an important role in the
            formation of democratic India .
            <br><br>
            Finally on 15th August of 1947 India became an
            independent nation after a prolonged struggle of almost
            200 years. This was a result of the fasts done by
            Gandhiji and the unity of the entire nation to oppose
            British rule.
            <br><br>
            On 30th of January of 1948 Nathuram Godse fired 3
            bullets into the chest of Gandhiji and killed him. This day
            in India is marked as martyrs day and 2 minutes of
            silence at 11 Am across India is maintained. The final
            words of gandhiji were,"HEY RAM".
