        <h4>
            In today's time we often see there are different versions of information which have
            been showcased by the media . This is applicable for print and digital forms of media
            which consists mostly of local and national level news pages and channels. It can be
            easily seen that there is difference between the information given by some parts of
            the digital and printed media while the other parts show something else which could
            be related to the topic but changes the perspective of the readers.<br><br>
            For example:- news paper X shows the benefits of all the policies been offered by the
            governing party at the national and state level ,while on the other hand a different
            newspaper company Y may try to show it as a counterfeit decision.<br><br>
            Such differences between two early morning news providers can make up for being a
            key reason of debate between the way that people see the government's working . It
            can be good or bad but it depends more on the version we read.<br><br>
            Fake news is a form of news consisting of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread
            via traditional news media (print and broadcast) or online social media. <br>Digital news
            has brought back and increased the usage of fake news, or yellow journalism. The
            news is then often reverberated as misinformation in social media but occasionally
            finds its way to the mainstream media as well.<br><br>
            Fake news is written and published usually with the intent to mislead in order to
            damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using
            sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership.
            Similarly, clickbait stories and headlines earn advertising revenue from this activity.<br><br>
            We must understand that even if fake news is able to get the spotlight ,we must get to
            the bottom of it by reading everything written or told about and not just looking at the
            headline and assume all that written about it has been provided. We must know that
            headlines are made attractive so that people stop to have a look at them and not just
            belief that the information provided by headlines is enough.<br><br>
            We are the fastest spreaders of fake news as in form of message or through social
            media sights and must be aware of what we share because if you are sharing a fake
            news then you are a part of the crime committed by a greedy for money , hater of a
            particulars personality ,etc .<br><br>
