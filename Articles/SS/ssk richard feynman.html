      <h4>
        On today’s occasion of teacher’s day, I would like to write about one of
        the greatest Physicists, and more importantly A great Teacher,
        Dr.Richard Feynman.
        <br /><br />
        Feynman was an american physicist who was not only famous for his work
        on the Manhattan project but was widely known for his fun way of
        teaching. He worked with other physicists like Robert Openheimer during
        the war to create the Nuclear warhead which would be deployed against
        Japan. He also was conferred the Nobel Prize for his work in the field
        of quantum electrodynamics with two other physicists. He also wrote two
        famous autobiographies namely, “Are you joking Mr. Feynman?” and “What
        do you Care What other people think”, Both of which are amazing reads
        and would recommend them to you all.
        <br /><br />
        But, Enough about his Achievements. Let’s talk about what made him a
        great teacher. He was famous for explaining most difficult and abstract
        concepts in a very easy and understandable way to everyone including
        children, students and even his own colleagues. He taught at famous
        universities like Cornell and Caltech and also gave lectures at several
        other colleges. Even while continuing his research, he still used to
        teach as he felt it was a refreshing activity. He believed that to gain
        complete mastery over a concept or subject, one has to teach other
        people about it. In fact, This technique of learning was named after
        him.
        <br /><br />
        Now, Let us discuss how we can use the “Feynman Technique” to improve
        the way we learn. There are 4 simple steps to it. They are:
        <br /><br />
        1.Select a topic or concept you want to learn<br />
        2.Break it down into simpler or smaller parts<br />
        3.Try teaching it to someone younger than you or pretend to teach
        someone<br />
        4.Find the Gaps in your explanation and revisit the concept/topic
        again<br />
        5.Repeat steps 1-4 until you gain complete mastery over the topic<br />
        <br />
        And as Dr.Feynman always said, learning is fun, and hence don’t forget
        to enjoy your learning. By following these simple steps, you can make
        learning anything new fun and easy. I hope that this learning technique
        will help you in your life. I believe that Dr. Feynman has shown us that
        no concept is too difficult to learn for any person of any age through
        his teaching and hence leave your apprehensions behind and enjoy your
        learning and become masters of the Subject.
        <br /><br />
        Happy learning and Happy Teachers Day to all!
