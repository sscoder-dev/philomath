            Hello Readers!
            <br><br>
            We at Philomath are working hard to provide quality and intresting articles for you to read and enjoy.
            Due to the recent health emergency, as everyone around<br> the world are at home following social distancing, we have put up this website to
            entertain our readers and promote the sharing of knowledge and fun. However,<br> as some readers might have noticed, our upload schedule is very
            irregular. We are trying our best to write more content for you all and once things get better, we will definitely start uploading articles
            on a regular schedule. This does not mean though that we won't be uploading articles at all. Please do be on the lookout for more articles 
            but do keep in mind that we cannot stick to a regular upload schedule as of now. 
            <br><br>
            Cheers
            <br>
            Philomath team
